## Introduction

This document describes the system requirements and how to use the Scalable Video Technology for HEVC Encoder (SVT-HEVC).  In particular, this user guide section describes how to run the sample application with the respective dynamically linked library.

## System Requirements

The SVT-HEVC Encoder library was developed to be supported on x86 for Windows\* and Linux\* operating systems.

### CPU requirements

In order to achieve the performance targeted by the deliverable, the specific CPU model listed in the Readme file would need to be used when running the encoder. Otherwise, the encoder should run on any 5th Generation Intel Core™ Processors (formerly Broadwell) CPUs (for example Xeon E5 v4) or newer, producing the same output.

### RAM requirements

In order to run the highest resolution supported by the encoder, at least 64GB of RAM is required to run a single 8kp60 10-bit encode. The encoder application will display an error if the system does not have enough RAM to support this resolution. The table below lists the minimum amount of RAM required for some standard resolutions of 10bit video per channel:

| **Resolution** | **Minimum Footprint in GB** |
| --- | --- |
| 8k | 64 |
| 4k | 16 |
| 1080p | 6 |
| 720p/1080i | 4 |
| 480p | 3 |

## Sample Application Guide

This section describes how to run the sample encoder application that uses the SVT-HEVC Encoder library.  It describes the input video format, the command line input parameters and the resulting outputs.

### Input Video Format

The SVT-HEVC Encoder supports the following input formats:

8-bit yuv420p
<br>
![alt](8bit_yuv420p_1.png)

<br>

10-bit yuv420p10le
<br>
![alt](10bit_yuv420p.png)
 

### Compressed 10-bit format

In order to reduce the size of the input original YUV file, the SVT-HEVC Encoder uses a compressed 10-bit format allowing the software to achieve a higher speed and channel density levels. The conversion between the 10-bit yuv420p10le and the compressed 10-bit format is a lossless operation and is performed using the following steps.

#### Unpack the 10 bit picture

This step consists of separating the 10 bit video samples into 8 bit and 2 bit planes so that each 10-bit picture will be represented as two separate pictures as shown in the figure below. As a result of the operation, the 2 least significant bits of the 10 bits will be written into a full byte.

 ![alt](10bit_unpacked.png)

<br>
10-bit yuv420p10le unpacked

#### Compress the 2 bit Plane

The unpacking steps separates the 10bits into a group of 8 bits and a group of 2 bits, where the 2 bits are stored in a byte. In this step, every group of consecutive 4 bytes, each containing 2bits from the unpacking step, are compressed into one byte. As a result, each 10bit picture will be represented as two separate pictures as shown in the figure below.

 ![alt](10bit_packed.png)

#### Unroll the 64x64

Now for a faster read of the samples, every 64x64 block of the 2 bit picture should be written into a one dimensional array. Therefore, the top left 64x64 sample block which is now written into a 16 bytes x 64 bytes after the compression of the 2bit samples, will be written into a 1024 bytes x 1 byte array as shown in the picture below.

### Running the encoder

This section describes how to run the sample encoder application <u>SvtHevcEncApp.exe</u> (on Windows\*) or <u>SvtHevcEncApp</u> (on Linux\*) from the command line, including descriptions of the most commonly used input parameters and outputs.

The sample application typically takes the following command line parameters:

>-c filename [**Optional**]

A text file that contains encoder parameters such as input file name, quantization parameter etc. Refer to the comments in the Config/Sample.cfg for specific details. The list of encoder parameters are also listed below. Note that command line parameters take precedence over the parameters included in the configuration file when there is a conflict.

>-tune integer **[Optional]**

This token sets the encoder to run in either the subjective quality optimized mode (when set to 0) or in the objective quality optimized mode (when set to 1 [default setting])

>-i filename **[Required]**

A YUV file (e.g. 8 bit 4:2:0 planar) containing the video sequence that will be encoded.  The dimensions of each image are specified by –w and –h as indicated below.

>-b filename **[Optional]**

The resulting encoded bit stream file in binary format. If none specified, no output bit stream will be produced by the encoder.

>-w integer **[Required]**

The width of each input image in units of picture luma pixels,  e.g. 1920

>-h integer **[Required]**]

The height of each input image in units of picture luma pixels,  e.g. 1080

>-n integer **[Optional]**

The number of frames of the sequence to encode.  e.g. 100. If the input frame count is larger than the number of frames in the input video, the encoder will loop back to the first frame when it&#39;s done.

>-intra-period integer **[Optional]**

The intra period defines the interval of frames after which you insert an Intra refresh. It is strongly recommended to use (multiple of 8) -1 the closest to 1 second (e.g. 55, 47, 31, 23 should be used for 60, 50, 30, (24 or 25) respectively)

>-rc integer **[Optional]**

This token sets the bitrate control encoding mode [1: Variable Bitrate, 0: Constant QP]. When rc is set to 1, it&#39;s best to match the –lad (lookahead distance described in the next section) parameter to the -intra-period. When –rc is set to 0, a qp value is expected with the use of the –q command line option otherwise a default value is assigned (25).

>-speed-ctrl integer **[Optional]**

This token sets the encoder to automatically choose the best quality encoding mode that allows the encoder to run at a real-time speed set by the –fps parameter (described in the next section).

For example, the following command encodes 100 frames of the YUV video sequence into the bin bit stream file.  The picture is 1920 luma pixels wide and 1080 pixels high using the Sample.cfg configuration. The QP equals 30 and the md5 checksum is not included in the bit stream.

> SvtHevcEncApp.exe -c Sample.cfg -i CrowdRun\_1920x1080.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -n 100 -q 30 -intra-period 31 -b CrowdRun\_1920x1080\_qp30.bin

It should be noted that not all the encoder parameters present in the Sample.cfg can be changed using the command line.

### Encoding presets table

The table below shows the preset availability per encoding mode and resolution.

![alt](encoding_mode_res_table.png)


## Best Known Configurations (BKC)

This section outlines the best known hardware and software configurations that would allow the SVT-HEVC Encoder to run with the highest computational performance. For the CQP mode, the output bit stream will not change if these BKCs have not been applied.


### Hardware BKC

The SVT-HEVC Encoder is optimized for use on Xeon® Scalable Processors products. For best multichannel encode, servers should be set up with at least one 2666 Mhz DDR4 RAM DIMM per RAM channel per socket. For example, a dual Xeon Platinum 8180 server is best set up with 12 x 2666 Mhz DDR4 RAM DIMM.


### Software BKC

#### *10 bit Input YUV*

Due to the large size of 10-bit video, using the compressed YUV format as shown in section 3.2 allows for the best performance of the encoder.

#### *Windows\* OS (Tested on Windows\* Server 2016)*

Visual Studio 2017 offers Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) to improve compiler optimization for the application. The tool uses an instrumented build to generate a set of profile information of the most frequently used code and optimal paths. The profile is then used to provide extra information for the compiler to optimize the application. To take advantage of PGO, build using the following:

1. Open the solution file with Visual Studio 2017 and build code in Release mode
2. Right click SvtHevcEncApp project from the Solution Explorer -> Profile Guided Optimization -> Instrument (Repeat for SvtHevcEnc)
3. Right click SvtHevcEncApp project from the Solution Explorer -> Properties -> Debugging
4. Add configuration parameters and run encoder (e.g. 1280x720 video encode of 300 frames)
5. Right click SvtHevcEncApp project from the Solution Explorer -> Profile Guided Optimization -> Run Instrumented/Optimized Application
6. Right click SvtHevcEncApp project from the Solution Explorer -> Profile Guided Optimization -> Optimize (Repeat for SvtHevcEnc)

#### *Linux\* OS (Tested on Ubuntu\* Server 18.04 and 16.04)*

Some Linux\* Operating systems and kernels assign CPU utilization limits to applications running on servers. Therefore, to allow the application to utilize up to ~100% of the CPUs assigned to it, it is best to run the following commands before and when running the encoder:

>sudo  sysctl  -w  kernel.sched\_rt\_runtime\_us=1000000
- this command should be executed every time the server is rebooted

The above section is not needed for Windows\* as it does not perform the CPU utilization limitation on the application.

### Command line BKC

The SVT-HEVC encoder achieves the best performance when restricting each channel to only one socket on either Windows\* or Linux\* operating systems. For example, when running four channels on a dual socket system, it&#39;s best to pin two channels to each socket and not split every channel on both sockets.

LogicalProcessorNumber (-lp) and TargetSocket (-ss) parameters can be used to management the threads. Or you can use OS commands like below.

For example, in order to run a 6-stream 4kp60 simultaneous encode on a Xeon Platinum 8180 system the following command lines should be used:

## Appendix A Encoder Parameters

### Hierarchical coding structure parameters

The GOP is constructed assuming a prediction structure (PredStructure: LowDelay/Random-Access) and hierarchical levels (HierarchicalLevels: number of hierarchical layers).

The prediction structure (PredStructure) in SVT-HEVC encoder supports two main structures which are:

- Low Delay (P or B): In a LowDelay structure, pictures within a mini-GOP refer to the previously encoded pictures in display order. In other words, pictures with display order N can only be referenced by pictures with display order greater than N, and it can only refer pictures with picture order lower than N.  The LowDelay prediction structure can be flat structured (e.g. IPPPPPPP….) or hierarchically structured as described in Figure A where a 3-Layer Hierarchical-LowDelay-P Structure is shown.

![alt](3-layer-hierarchical-low-delay.png)

In a LowDelay structure, B/b pictures can be used instead of P/p pictures. However, the reference picture list 0 and the reference picture list 1 will contain the same reference picture as described in Figure B.

![alt](3-layer-hierarchical-low-delay2.png)

- Random Access: In this prediction structure, the B/b pictures can refer to reference pictures from both directions (past and future). Figure C shows an example of a three-layer random access prediction structure. In this figure, the B picture at temporal layer 0 can be replaced with a P picture and this is can be done through the configuration parameter "BaseLayerSwitchMode" by setting it to "1".

![alt](3-layer-hierarchical-low-delay3.png)

In the SVT-HEVC code, the GOP structure is constructed in the Picture Decision process which performs multi-picture level decisions, including setting the prediction structure, setting the picture type, and scene change detection.  Since the prior Picture Analysis processes stage is multithreaded, inputs to the Picture Decision Process can arrive out-of-display-order, so a reordering queue is used to enforce processing of pictures in display order.  The algorithms employed in the Picture Decision process are dependent on prior pictures' statistics, so the order in which pictures are processed must be strictly enforced.  Additionally, the Picture Decision process uses the reorder queue to hold input pictures until they are ready to be sent to the Motion Analysis process, following the proper prediction structure.

### Thread management parameters

LogicalProcessorNumber (-lp) and TargetSocket (-ss) parameters are used to management thread affinity on Windows and Ubuntu OS. These are some examples how you use them together.

If LogicalProcessorNumber and TargetSocket are not set, threads are managed by OS thread scheduler.

>SvtHevcEncApp.exe -i in.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 –lp 40

If only LogicalProcessorNumber is set, threads run on 40 logical processors. Threads may run on dual sockets if 40 is larger than logical processor number of a socket.

NOTE: On Windows, thread affinity can be set only by group on system with more than 64 logical processors. So, if 40 is larger than logical processor number of a single socket, threads run on all logical processors of both sockets.

>SvtHevcEncApp.exe -i in.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 –ss 1

If only TargetSocket is set, threads run on all the logical processors of socket 1.

>SvtHevcEncApp.exe -i in.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 –lp 20 –ss 0

If both LogicalProcessorNumber and TargetSocket are set, threads run on 20 logical processors of socket 0. Threads guaranteed to run only on socket 0 if 20 is larger than logical processor number of socket 0.
